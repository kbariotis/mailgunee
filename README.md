# mailgunee

I like [mailgun](https://mailgun.com). But not having a way
to preview sent emails bodies is the least fun process ever.

I also refuse to accept that the only way to do it [is this](http://blog.mailgun.com/how-to-view-your-messages/).

I thought I could help by creating this CLI.

## Install

Just install:

`> npm install -g mailgunee`

and run:

`> mailgunee`

You will have to provide your mailgun [API key](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203380100-Where-can-I-find-my-API-key-and-SMTP-credentials-). mailgunee is going to save it in your home directory
so to not bother you every time.
